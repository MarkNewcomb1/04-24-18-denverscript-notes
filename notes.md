### Managing State
State means keeping track of what the current thing is.

The URL is very good at state.
Tip on building with state in mind - think about the state *first*, and what all that stores. THEN think about what components you need to build. 
Having said that, treat state as a necessary evil. If you don't need to store it, then don't.

Makes making ideas in web UI development more approachable. 
created by Evan You when working for google prototyping browser elements. 
Syntax is HTML-based instead of something like React, which uses JSX.
